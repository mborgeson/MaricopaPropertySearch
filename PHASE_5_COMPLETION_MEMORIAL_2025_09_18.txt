✅ Performance Benchmarking
   - test_performance_benchmarks.py: 14 benchmarks
   - Baseline validation: 0.04s basic, 0.33s comprehensive
   - Regression detection for all critical paths
   - Memory usage and resource monitoring

✅ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - 9-stage quality pipeline with parallel execution
   - Code quality checks (Black, isort, Flake8, Pylint, mypy)
   - Security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
   - Unit tests by component with coverage reporting
   - Integration and system test stages
   - Performance benchmarking with regression detection

✅ Pre-commit Hooks Configuration
   - 10+ quality tools integrated
   - Automatic code formatting (Black, isort)
   - Linting and type checking (Flake8, mypy, Pylint)
   - Security scanning (Bandit)
   - Documentation validation (markdownlint)
