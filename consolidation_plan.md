- Bedroom/bathroom count filters
- Pool presence filter
- Sort options

### 2. Search Caching System (from optimized_main_window.py)
- High-performance result caching
- Cache hit ratio tracking
- Cache invalidation controls
- Memory usage monitoring

### 3. UX Message Improvements (from ux_fixed and improved versions)
- Replace "Not Available" with actionable messages
- Add helpful tooltips and guidance
- Improve error messaging with user-friendly explanations
- Add progress indicators for data collection

### 4. Performance Analytics (from optimized_main_window.py)
- Search performance monitoring
- Usage analytics
- Query performance tracking
- Database optimization tools

### 5. Debug Features (from main_window.py)
- Debug output panel
- Log file reading
- Result debugging
- Database cache management

## Integration Priority

### High Priority (Phase 1)
1. UX message improvements - immediate user experience benefit
2. Advanced search filters - essential functionality gap
3. Debug features - development and troubleshooting support

### Medium Priority (Phase 2)
1. Search caching - performance optimization
2. Performance analytics - monitoring and optimization

### Low Priority (Phase 3)
1. Additional UI refinements
2. Extended validation features

## Files to Delete After Consolidation

Once consolidation is complete, delete these files:
- `optimized_main_window.py`
- `main_window_ux_fixed.py` 
- `improved_main_window.py`
- `main_window.py`

Keep only:
- `enhanced_main_window.py` (consolidated version)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Backup current files**
2. **Create consolidated version based on enhanced_main_window.py**
3. **Integrate UX improvements first**
4. **Add advanced search filters**
5. **Add debug features**
6. **Add caching system**
7. **Add performance monitoring**
8. **Test thoroughly**
9. **Delete redundant files**

## Expected Benefits

- Single authoritative GUI implementation
- Best features from all versions combined
- Improved maintainability
- Enhanced user experience
- Better performance and debugging capabilities
- Reduced code duplication

## Risk Mitigation

- Keep backups of all original files
- Test each integration phase thoroughly
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing database schema
- Preserve all existing functionality during consolidation
