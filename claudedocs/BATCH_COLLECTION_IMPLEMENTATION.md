## Technical Implementation Details

### New Classes Added

#### BatchCollectionTracker
```python
class BatchCollectionTracker(QObject):
    """Tracks batch data collection operations"""
    
    # Signals
    batch_started = pyqtSignal(int)      # total_properties
    batch_progress = pyqtSignal(int, int) # completed, total  
    batch_completed = pyqtSignal(dict)    # results summary
```

**Key Methods:**
- `start_batch(apns)`: Initialize batch tracking
- `update_batch_progress(apn, result)`: Update progress for completed APN
- `cancel_batch()`: Cancel current batch operation
- `is_batch_active()`: Check if batch is currently running

### Enhanced Methods

#### BackgroundDataCollectionManager
- **New Method**: `collect_batch_data()` for comprehensive batch operations
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Smart duplicate and completion detection
- **Detailed Results**: Returns comprehensive batch operation feedback

#### EnhancedPropertySearchApp  
- **Enhanced Method**: `collect_all_data()` with smart pre-filtering
- **New Method**: `_do_collect_all_data()` for actual batch execution
- **New Method**: `_on_batch_collection_completed()` for completion handling

### UI Enhancements

#### Status Widget Improvements
- Added batch progress section (initially hidden)
- Cancel batch functionality
- Real-time batch status updates
- Automatic cleanup after completion

#### Button State Management
- Disabled during batch operations
- Visual feedback with text changes
- Automatic re-enable on completion
- Error handling with proper reset

## User Experience Flow

1. **Search Properties**: User performs property search
2. **Review Results**: Search results display with data status indicators
3. **Click "Collect All Data"**: User initiates batch collection
4. **Smart Filtering**: System analyzes which properties need data collection
5. **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows detailed summary of batch operation
6. **Batch Execution**: High-priority jobs queued for 3 concurrent workers
7. **Real-time Progress**: 
   - Batch progress bar shows overall progress
   - Individual property statuses update in results table
   - Status messages show current operations
8. **Completion**: 
   - Completion dialog with detailed statistics
   - Button re-enabled for future use
   - All UI elements reset to ready state

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Handled Scenarios
- **No Search Results**: Warning message displayed
- **All Properties Current**: Information dialog with skip reasons
- **Worker Not Running**: Option to start background collection
- **Batch Already Active**: Option to cancel and restart
- **Individual Job Failures**: Tracked and reported in batch summary
- **Network/API Failures**: Proper error handling and user notification

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Auto-retry**: Failed jobs automatically retry with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Batch continues even if some properties fail
- **Resource Protection**: Prevents overwhelming system with duplicate requests
- **State Recovery**: UI properly resets on any error condition

## Performance Characteristics
