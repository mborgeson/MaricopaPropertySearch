# Comprehensive Test Plan - Maricopa Property Search Application

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive test plan addresses the critical UX and performance challenges identified in the property search application redesign. The testing strategy focuses on ensuring professional appearance, reliable performance, and graceful error handling across all user scenarios.

## System Under Test Overview

**Application**: Property search with progressive data enhancement
**Architecture**: PyQt5 GUI + PostgreSQL + Multiple data sources (API/Web scraping)
**Key Challenge**: Previously appeared "broken" despite technical functionality
**Goal**: Ensure consistent professional user experience

## 1. Test Strategy Framework

### 1.1 Risk-Based Testing Priorities

**HIGH RISK (Critical Path)**
- Initial user impression and professional appearance
- Search responsiveness and loading states
- Background data collection without UI blocking
- Error handling and graceful degradation

**MEDIUM RISK (Core Functionality)**
- Data accuracy and consistency across sources
- Database performance under load
- Cache effectiveness and duplicate prevention

**LOW RISK (Edge Cases)**
- Rare property types and data formats
- Extended network timeouts
- Database connection recovery

### 1.2 Testing Methodology Matrix

| Test Type | Coverage | Tools | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Unit Tests | Individual components | pytest | Every commit |
| Integration | Data flow & APIs | pytest + custom | Daily |
| Performance | Response times & load | pytest-benchmark | Weekly |
| E2E Tests | Complete user journeys | Playwright | Release |
| Visual | UI appearance & UX | Playwright + screenshots | Release |
