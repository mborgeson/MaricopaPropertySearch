   - üí° **Solution**: `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`

2. **Property Documents (`get_property_documents`)**
   - ‚ùå 0% success rate
   - üö® **Root Cause**: Missing Playwright dependency
   - üí° **Solution**: `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`

3. **Mock Client Issues**
   - ‚ùå Missing implementation for several methods
   - üö® **Root Cause**: Incomplete MockMaricopaAPIClient class
   - ‚úÖ **Solution**: Created `FixedMockMaricopaAPIClient` with all methods

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PERFORMANCE ISSUES

1. **Slow Property Details Retrieval**
   - Response times: 6-7 seconds
   - Cause: Multiple sequential API calls
   - Recommendation: Implement parallel requests or caching

2. **Address Search Performance**
   - Response times: 1-3 seconds
   - May need optimization for better user experience

1. **Implement Caching**
   - Cache property details for 24 hours
   - Implement request deduplication
   - Add database-level caching

2. **Optimize Parallel Requests**
   - Make concurrent calls to multiple endpoints
   - Reduce property details response time from 7s to <2s

### üìà MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhancement)

1. **Add Monitoring**
   - API health checks
   - Response time monitoring
   - Error rate tracking

2. **Improve User Experience**
   - Add progress indicators for slow operations
   - Implement request queuing for bulk operations
   - Add retry buttons for failed requests

### üîÑ LONG-TERM (Architecture)

1. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Local data caching
   - Database-first search with API fallback

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Property comparison tools
   - Market analysis features
   - Automated reporting
