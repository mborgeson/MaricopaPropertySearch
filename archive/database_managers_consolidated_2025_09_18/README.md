# Database Manager Consolidation Archive - Phase 2.2

This directory contains the database manager files that were consolidated into database_manager_unified.py on 2025-09-18.

## Files Archived:
- database_manager.py - Original base implementation (550 lines)

## Consolidated Into:
- src/database_manager_unified.py - Single unified database manager with all features

## Phase 2.2 Results:
- Reduced from 2 database manager files to 1 unified implementation
- Maintained all functionality with enhanced thread safety and performance monitoring
- Added comprehensive error handling and bulk operations
- Enhanced connection pooling and statistics tracking

## Features Consolidated:
- Basic CRUD operations (from database_manager.py)
- Thread-safe connection pooling (from threadsafe_database_manager.py)
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Bulk insert operations for efficiency
- Data collection status tracking
- Advanced error handling and recovery
- Full backward compatibility with both previous interfaces

## Unified Features:
- Configurable connection pooling (5-20 connections by default)
- Real-time performance statistics and monitoring
- Thread-safe operations with RLock and context managers
- Bulk operations: bulk_insert_tax_history(), bulk_insert_sales_history()
- Data collection workflow: get_data_collection_status(), mark_collection_*()
- Comprehensive validation: validate_property_data()
- Enhanced analytics: get_database_performance_stats()

All functionality has been preserved and enhanced in the unified implementation.

## Migration Details:
- threadsafe_database_manager.py now imports from database_manager_unified.py
- All existing imports continue to work without modification
- Enhanced features available to all existing code
- Performance improvements through unified connection pooling
