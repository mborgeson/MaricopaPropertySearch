- **Recommendation**: Implement proper unit and integration tests

#### 4. **File Organization**
- **Score: 7/10**
- **Issue**: 34 Python files in src/ directory, some could be better organized
- **Recommendation**: Create subdirectories for related functionality (api/, gui/, db/, etc.)

## Technical Deep Dive

### ConfigManager Implementation ✅ ROBUST
```python
def get(self, key: str, default=None, section: str = 'application'):
    """Get configuration value with default fallback"""
    try:
        if section in self.config and key in self.config[section]:
            value = self.config.get(section, key)
            if isinstance(default, bool):
                return self.config.getboolean(section, key)
            elif isinstance(default, int):
                return self.config.getint(section, key)
            return value
        return default
    except:
        return default
```
**Analysis**: Excellent type-aware configuration retrieval with proper fallbacks.

### PySide6→PyQt5 Conversion ✅ WELL EXECUTED
- **Compatibility**: Proper signal handling conversion (`pyqtSignal`)
- **Import Management**: Clean PyQt5 imports with fallback handling
- **Widget Integration**: All GUI components properly converted
- **Standards Compliance**: Maintains code quality during framework transition

### Threading & Concurrency ✅ PROFESSIONAL GRADE
```python
class BackgroundDataWorker(QThread):
    def __init__(self, db_manager, max_concurrent_jobs: int = 3):
        # Thread-safe job queue with priority support
        self.job_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_concurrent_jobs)
```
**Analysis**: Proper use of threading primitives, job queues, and resource management.

## Security Assessment ✅ GOOD

### Positive Security Practices:
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries consistently used
- **Credential Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
