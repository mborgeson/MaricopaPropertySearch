Those definitely aren't the correct scripts. The main launcher script is "RUN_APPLICATION.py". That took me five seconds of
reading your tghe sumarized output of what you completed, and now I don't have much faith in your ability,. in your current
singular state, to complete  the project. As sdch, please see below for commentary and listed items related to process, the
absolute requirement for an amazing team of AI agents compiled by Task orchestrator or manager, and will be implemented by
the manager/orchestrator on a parallel basis to compelete tasks more efficiently, but this implementation of multiple agentgs
working on the same taks, but in materially differentg capacities has the potential for the highest level refinements of a
process/program and the highest chance of catching an issue that may have not presented itself if only one agentg was working
through it at a time. 

For this Task/process I want to utilize a heavy agentic component to ensure this task is tackled by a team with specialists and will be a able to parallel proces certain aspects of the this request as they first create a plan for their workflow. Further, I would like to utilize the Claude-Flow and SPARC mcp servers/packages, which are both very good individually, are amazing when used in conjunction with each together. Additionally, please make sure to generate a detailed plan (there are a few approaches out there, but the BMAD method is a staple in the programming world and has been around for a long time, although the timing convention for it is new).

Also, please incorporate "/hooks" functionality all throughout your process in order to ensure nothing big or small falls through cracks, there is never an absence of quality documentation that all of the changes/updates that were made for a given task, along with the rationale behind why making the change was necessary and how it will be beneficial to the project. 

Also, please see below for a list of additional process requirements when approaching this task at hand:
Additional Process Methods :
If I wanted to utilize agents to review a project and perform the following:
        1. Thoroughly review and understand the project's purpose, directory structure, and codebase/files;
        2. identify the various project scripts, determine the function of each script and then group scripts by their function (e.g., two different
   scripts that both were used to launch a dashboard would be grouped together as dashboard launcher scripts). Once all project scripts have been
   accounted for and placed into a like-kind group, then I will need a list to be generated enumerating the scripts in each group and their absolute
   path;
        3. Each group list will be reviewed for a second time to detemrine the most complete, best performing, and highest overall quality script from
   that group, in regard to performing its function/task. Even after the optimal script is determined, there needs to be one final review of the other
   scripts in the same group to see if any of the functionality in those scripts could be utilized somewhere within the optimal script's code, and
   finally after all of the best code has been incorporated into a single script, then the remaining deprecated scripts will be deleted;
        4. Now there should be a large reduction in the project's scripts (i.e., there should ideally be one script per specific task/function). At this
   point the project key documentation files need to be updated to reflect the list of AUTHORITATIVE and SOLE scripts for each function/task;
        5. At this point there needs to be a detailed review of the existing codebase files to ensure all references, including those to other scripts,
   are accurate and complete, the package requirements are fully satisfied, the project structure is logical and laid out in a recommended structure,
   and there are no useless/rogue files sitting anywhere in the project directory's various folders;
        6. Perform extensive tsting over all of the project's key scripts, both individually and whether any of the scripts require other's running
   prior to it being run, in order to identify errors, performance issues, areas to reduce technical debt, and finally leave the project as a production
   ready project; and
        7. Finally, after the work performed in the previous six steps, the comprehensive existing project documentation files need to be thoroughly reviewed and updated, where applicable, for the current state of the project across every aspect of the project.
