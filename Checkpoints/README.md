# Project Checkpoints

This folder contains timestamped snapshots of project status, architecture decisions, and next steps for the Maricopa Property Search GUI Project.

## Purpose

- **Context Preservation:** Save comprehensive project state at key milestones
- **Work Resumption:** Easily continue work with full context after breaks
- **Audit Trail:** Track major changes and decisions over time
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Share project status with team members

## Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `MCA_GUI_AUDIT_CHECKPOINT_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.md`

- Date format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Time format: 24-hour (HHMM)
- Timezone: PST/PDT

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View latest checkpoint
ls -t *.md | grep -v README | head -1 | xargs cat

# List all checkpoints (newest first)
ls -t *.md | grep -v README

# Search checkpoints for specific content
grep -l "market_analysis" *.md

# Create new checkpoint (template)
cp "$(ls -t *.md | grep -v README | head -1)" "MCA_GUI_AUDIT_CHECKPOINT_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M).md"
```

## Checkpoint Contents

Each checkpoint typically includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Key achievements and metrics
2. **Current Architecture Status** - System state overview
3. **Next Steps Checklist** - Prioritized action items
4. **Technical Debt Targets** - Files needing refactoring
5. **File Structure Overview** - Current project organization
6. **Key Commands** - Useful commands for continuation
7. **Performance Metrics** - Current system benchmarks
8. **Risk Assessment** - Active risks and mitigations
9. **Session Resume Instructions** - How to continue work

## Integration with MCP Servers

Checkpoints are also stored in:

- **Knowledge Graph:** Via mcp__knowledge-graph for structured relationships
- **Memory Systems:** For searchable context retrieval
- **Git:** Track checkpoint creation in version control

## Best Practices

1. Create checkpoint after major milestones
2. Include specific commit hashes for reference
3. Document both completed work and remaining tasks
4. Update risk assessments with each checkpoint
5. Include code metrics (line counts, complexity scores)
